-> Download ZooKeeper from below URL
https://apachemirror.wuchna.com/zookeeper/zookeeper-3.7.0/apache-zookeeper-3.7.0-bin.tar.gz

-> Download Kafka from below URL
https://apachemirror.wuchna.com/kafka/2.8.0/kafka_2.12-2.8.0.tgz

after extraction rename kafka_2.12-2.8.0 with kafka


-> Start ZooKeeper
D:\Software\Kafka\zookeeper\apache-zookeeper-3.7.0-bin\bin zkServer.bat

-> Start Kafka server
Open cmd from D:\Software\Kafka\kafka\bin\windows and run below command
.\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties

-> Create Topics
Open cmd from D:\Software\Kafka\kafka\bin\windows and run below command

kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test

-> Start producer

Open cmd from D:\Software\Kafka\kafka\bin\windows and run below command
kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test

-> Start Consumer

Open cmd from D:\Software\Kafka\kafka\bin\windows and run below command
kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test


Now you can push message from producer window and can see in consumer window

B. ZooKeeper Installation
1. Go to your ZooKeeper config directory. For me its C:\zookeeper-3.4.7\conf

2. Rename file “zoo_sample.cfg” to “zoo.cfg”

3. Open zoo.cfg in any text editor, like Notepad; I prefer Notepad++.

4. Find and edit dataDir=/tmp/zookeeper to :\zookeeper-3.4.7\data  

5. Add an entry in the System Environment Variables as we did for Java.

a. Add ZOOKEEPER_HOME = C:\zookeeper-3.4.7 to the System Variables.

b. Edit the System Variable named “Path” and add ;%ZOOKEEPER_HOME%\bin; 

6. You can change the default Zookeeper port in zoo.cfg file (Default port 2181).

7. Run ZooKeeper by opening a new cmd and type zkserver.

C. Setting Up Kafka
1. Go to your Kafka config directory. For me its C:\kafka_2.11-0.9.0.0\config

2. Edit the file “server.properties.”

3. Find and edit the line log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs” to “log.dir= C:\kafka_2.11-0.9.0.0\kafka-logs.

4. If your ZooKeeper is running on some other machine or cluster you can edit “zookeeper.connect:2181” to your custom IP and port. For this demo, we are using the same machine so there's no need to change. Also the Kafka port and broker.id are configurable in this file. Leave other settings as is.

5. Your Kafka will run on default port 9092 and connect to ZooKeeper’s default port, 2181.


After that follow above coomands of Kafka.
